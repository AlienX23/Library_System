# 📚 Simple Java Library System

This is a personal project developed to **revisit and apply core Java concepts** by building a simple application.

---

## ✨ Overview

This system is a basic console-based application designed to manage the available books in a small library. It uses **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles to handle book data.

## 🚀 Key Features

The system provides the following core library management functionalities:

* **View All Books:** Check the complete list of all books currently stored in the system.
* **Book Checkout:** Allow users to check out an available book using its **Book Name** or **Book ID**.
* **Book Return:** Process the return of a book using its **Book Name** or **Book ID**.
* **Search:** Find specific books using criteria such as **Book ID**, **Book Name**, or **Author Name**.
* **Add New Book:** Easily add new book records to the library system.

## 🗃️ Data Structure

Each book is stored as a custom **Book object** within an **`ArrayList`**. The following properties are maintained for every book record:

* **Unique Book ID**
* **Book Name**
* **Author Name**

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

* **Language:** Java
* **Data Structure:** `ArrayList` (Custom Book Object)

## 💻 Getting Started (How to Run)

Since this is a console application, you would typically compile and run the main class.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [Your-Repository-URL]
    ```
2.  **Compile and Run:**
    * *If using an IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA):* Open the project and run the **`Main`** class.
    * *If using the command line:* Navigate to the project root and compile/run the application starting with the `Main` class.
